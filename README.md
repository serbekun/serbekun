# 👋 Hi there! I'm Mishchenko Sergey (aka serbekun)

🎒 I'm 13 years old and currently studying at Kukizaki Junior High School.  
💻 I'm passionate about programming and building real-world projects.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 💾 **C / C++** — working with memory, file systems, data structures, and algorithms  
- 🐍 **Python** — building AI, neural networks, and small games  
- 💡 Learning algorithms, low-level code, and system programming  

## 🌍 Languages I Speak

- 🇷🇺 **Russian** — native  
- 🇯🇵 **Japanese** — fluent  
- 🇬🇧 **English** — learning and improving every day  

## 🚀 Projects

- 🧠 [**Variable Battle AI**](https://github.com/serbekun/Variable-Battle) — a neural network that learns to play a text-based strategy game  
- 📁 [**basic_file**](https://github.com/serbekun/basic_file) — a simple and reusable C++ file class  
- ⚙️ [More repositories here](https://github.com/serbekun?tab=repositories)  

## 🌱 Goals

- Improve my programming skills through real coding challenges  
- Compete in programming contests and hackathons  
- Create tools, games, and libraries that others can use  
- Learn more about open-source culture  

## 🤝 I'd Love to Contribute!

I'm very interested in participating in open-source projects.
