# 👋 Hi there! I'm Mishchenko Sergey (aka serbekun)

🎒 I'm 13 years old and currently studying at Kukizaki Juniar Hight School.  
💻 I'm passionate about programming and building real-world projects.

## 🧠 What I do

- 💾 C / C++ — working with memory, file systems, and data structures  
- 🐍 Python — building AI, neural networks, and small games  
- 🛠️ Bash — writing scripts to automate things  
- 💡 Learning algorithms, low-level code, and system programming

## 🌍 Languages I speak

- 🇷🇺 Russian — native  
- 🇯🇵 Japanese — fluent  
- 🇬🇧/🇺🇸 English — learning and improving every day

## 🚀 Projects

- 🧠 [`Variable Battle AI`](https://github.com/serbekun/Variable-Battle) — a neural network that learns to play a text-based strategy game  
- 📁 [`basic_file`](https://github.com/serbekun/basic_file) — a simple and reusable C++ file class  
- ⚙️ [More repositories here](https://github.com/serbekun?tab=repositories)

## 🌱 Goals

- Improve my programming skills through real coding challenges  
- Compete in programming contests and hackathons  
- Create tools, games, and libraries that others can use  
- Learn more about open-source culture

## 🤝 I'd love to contribute!
